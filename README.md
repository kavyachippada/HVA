# IMDB Movies and TV Shows Analysis

## Overview

This project is part of the **Mini Hackathon 1.0 - Data Science Track**. The objective was to analyze a dataset featuring the top 1000 movies and TV shows from IMDB, focusing on data processing, analysis, and visualization to uncover meaningful insights.

## Project Structure

- **Data Preprocessing**: All preprocessing tasks were done using Kaggle. The dataset was cleaned and prepared for analysis.
- **SQL Queries**: The data analysis was conducted using SQL queries in BigQuery. The queries explore various aspects of the dataset, such as director impact, genre popularity, and the correlation between IMDB ratings and gross earnings.
- **Visualizations**: The visualizations were created in Power BI to effectively communicate the insights derived from the analysis.

## Key Areas of Analysis

1. **Director's Impact on Earnings**: Analysis of how different directors' movies performed in terms of gross earnings.
2. **Genre Popularity Over the Years**: Investigation into the evolution of genre popularity over time.
